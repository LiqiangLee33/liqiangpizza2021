I got the user interface for the web from a student of mine, Pat Wilken.

To run:

1. Sign up for paypal developer sandbox and get a client id
2. The first time run `npm install`
3. `SB_CLIENT_ID=<put_in_your_client_id> npm start`

## Assignment 2

Extend the order bot from assignment 1. You need to have at least 2 items on the menu unless your favourite food is pizza in which case you need to have 3 (I did pizza already). The menu items need to have size and one other attribute like toppings. You also need an up-sell item like drinks in the example.

For Assignment 2 you need to add paypal and a payment screen as in the scaffold.

### Marking

basic order for an item with payment in a zip (65%)
calculation of amount (up to 10%)
error handling (up to 10%)
get the delivery address from paypal's shipping address (up to 15%)

There is a brief [presentation here](ES6Templates.pdf).
