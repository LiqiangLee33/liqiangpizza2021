I got the user interface for the web from a student of mine, Pat Wilken.

A chatbot written in es6 and vs6 for twilio and testing on the web. The important files are index.js and game.js.

A popular theme for the upcoming Halloween holiday is to make haunted house simulations. You will make a choose your own adventure for a haunted house presented as a Twilio chatbot.
